    min_test_pass_rate=95.0,
    min_security_score=90.0
)

# Create progressive monitor
monitor = ProgressiveQualityMonitor(
    project_root=project_root,
    thresholds=thresholds,
    check_interval=5.0
)

# Create real-time dashboard
dashboard = RealTimeQualityMonitor(

## 🧠 Adaptive Thresholds

### Adaptation Strategies

#### 1. Trend Following
Adjusts thresholds based on recent quality trends:
```python
# If quality is improving, gradually raise standards
if trend_slope > 0:
    new_threshold = current + trend_adjustment
```

#### 2. Percentile Based
Sets thresholds based on historical performance:
```python
# Set threshold at 25th percentile of historical data
target_threshold = np.percentile(historical_values, 25)
```

#### 3. Performance Based
Adjusts based on violation rates:
```python
# If too many violations, lower threshold
# If very few violations, potentially raise threshold
if violation_rate > target_rate:
    new_threshold = current * adjustment_factor
```

### Adaptation Rules

```python
# Example adaptation rules
rules = [
    AdaptationRule(
        metric_name="code_coverage",
        adaptation_strategy="percentile_based",
        parameters={"percentile": 20, "max_change": 5.0},
        adaptation_rate=0.2
    ),
    AdaptationRule(
        metric_name="security_score", 
        adaptation_strategy="trend_following",
        parameters={"window_size": 15, "trend_factor": 0.05},
        adaptation_rate=0.1
    )
]
```

## 📱 Live Dashboard

### Features

- **Real-time Metrics**: Live updates via WebSocket
- **Quality Trends**: Historical charts with trend analysis
- **Active Alerts**: Current quality violations and warnings
- **System Status**: Monitoring system health and statistics

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Start Progressive Quality Gates system
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (default port)
3. View real-time quality metrics and trends
4. Monitor alerts and system status

### Dashboard Components

- **Metrics Panel**: Current quality scores and coverage
- **Trend Chart**: Historical quality score progression  
- **Alerts Panel**: Active quality violations
- **Status Panel**: System health and connection status

## 🚨 Alert System

### Alert Rules

```python
alert_rules = [
    AlertRule(
        name="Critical Security Vulnerability",
        condition="metrics.high_severity_vulnerabilities > 0",
        severity="critical",
        message="Critical security vulnerability detected",
        cooldown_seconds=60
    ),
    AlertRule(
        name="Low Test Coverage",
        condition="metrics.code_coverage < 70.0", 
        severity="high",
        message="Test coverage below 70%: {metrics.code_coverage:.1f}%",
        cooldown_seconds=300
    )
]
```

### Alert Severities

- **Critical**: Immediate action required (security vulnerabilities)
- **High**: Important issues (test failures, low coverage)
- **Medium**: Moderate concerns (performance degradation)
- **Low**: Minor issues (technical debt accumulation)

### Notification Handlers

```python
def slack_notification(alert):
    """Send alert to Slack channel."""
    # Implementation for Slack integration
    
def email_notification(alert):
    """Send alert via email."""
    # Implementation for email notifications

# Register handlers
monitor.add_notification_handler(slack_notification)
monitor.add_notification_handler(email_notification)
```
