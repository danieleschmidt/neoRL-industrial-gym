# Security Policies and Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the security policies, procedures, and best practices for the neoRL-industrial-gym project. Given the industrial and safety-critical nature of our reinforcement learning applications, security is paramount.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Assumption that any single control may fail
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### 2. Least Privilege
- Minimal necessary permissions for all components
- Regular access reviews and principle enforcement
- Automated privilege escalation detection

### 3. Zero Trust Architecture
- Never trust, always verify
- Continuous authentication and authorization
- Network segmentation and micro-segmentation

### 4. Security by Design
- Security considerations from the earliest design phases
- Threat modeling for all new features
- Regular security architecture reviews

## Branch Protection Policies

### Main Branch Protection
The `main` branch is protected with the following rules:

#### Required Status Checks
- **CI Pipeline**: All matrix tests (Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- **Security Scanning**: Dependency vulnerability scan must pass
- **Container Security**: Docker security scan must pass
- **Code Quality**: Linting and type checking must pass
- **Safety Validation**: Industrial safety checks must pass

#### Pull Request Requirements
- **Required Reviews**: Minimum 1 approving review from CODEOWNERS
- **Dismiss Stale Reviews**: Yes - re-review required after new commits
- **Required Review from CODEOWNERS**: Yes
- **Restrict Push**: Only allow squash merging
- **Require Up-to-Date Branches**: Yes

#### Additional Restrictions
- **Force Push**: Disabled
- **Deletions**: Restricted to administrators
- **Administrator Bypass**: Disabled for all rules

### Development Branch Protection
The `develop` branch has lighter protections:
- Required status checks (CI, security, quality)
- At least 1 approving review (not necessarily CODEOWNERS)
- Up-to-date branch requirement

### Release Branch Protection
Release branches (`release/*`) have special protections:
- All main branch protections
- Additional performance benchmark requirements
- Extended security validation
- Documentation completeness checks

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Scanning
- **Automated Scanning**: Dependabot runs weekly
- **Vulnerability Database**: GitHub Advisory Database + CVE
- **Response SLA**: 
  - Critical: 24 hours
  - High: 72 hours
  - Medium: 1 week
  - Low: 1 month

### Container Security
- **Base Image Updates**: Monthly security patching
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Trivy + Grype scanning
- **Runtime Security**: AppArmor/SELinux profiles
- **Secrets Management**: No secrets in images

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Bandit for Python security issues
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Planned integration with security testing
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory security-focused reviews
- **Security Training**: Regular training for all contributors

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classifications

#### Severity 1 (Critical)
- Data breach with PII/sensitive data exposure
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation to admin/root
- Production system compromise

**Response Time**: Immediate (within 1 hour)
**Escalation**: Notify all maintainers + security team

#### Severity 2 (High)
- SQL injection or similar injection attacks
- Authentication bypass
- Sensitive data exposure (non-PII)
- Denial of service affecting availability

**Response Time**: 4 hours
**Escalation**: Notify maintainers

#### Severity 3 (Medium)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Information disclosure
- Insecure configurations
- Minor privilege escalation

**Response Time**: 24 hours
**Escalation**: Standard issue tracking

#### Severity 4 (Low)
- Security configuration improvements
- Documentation updates
- Non-exploitable vulnerabilities

**Response Time**: 1 week
**Escalation**: Regular development workflow

### Response Procedures

1. **Detection & Assessment**
   - Identify and classify the security incident
   - Assess potential impact and affected systems
   - Determine if containment is needed

2. **Containment**
   - Isolate affected systems if necessary
   - Preserve evidence for investigation
   - Implement temporary fixes if available

3. **Investigation**
   - Conduct root cause analysis
   - Document timeline and impact
   - Identify similar vulnerabilities

4. **Recovery**
   - Implement permanent fixes
   - Test fixes thoroughly
   - Deploy to all affected environments

5. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct post-mortem review
   - Update security procedures
   - Share lessons learned

## Industrial Safety Security

### Safety-Critical Code Reviews
Special review requirements for safety-critical components:

- **Dual Review**: Two independent reviewers required
- **Safety Expert**: At least one reviewer must have industrial safety expertise
- **Testing Requirements**: Comprehensive safety testing including edge cases
- **Documentation**: Detailed safety documentation required

### Safety Validation Pipeline
- **Automated Safety Checks**: Run on every commit
- **Constraint Validation**: Verify all safety constraints
- **Simulation Testing**: Test in realistic industrial scenarios
- **Emergency Procedures**: Validate shutdown and safety mechanisms

### Compliance Requirements
