# Compliance & Regulatory Guidelines

This document outlines compliance considerations for industrial deployment of neoRL-industrial-gym.

## Regulatory Framework Mapping

### OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)

**Applicable Standards:**
- 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management
- 29 CFR 1910.147 - Lockout/Tagout procedures
- 29 CFR 1926.95 - Personal protective equipment

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Emergency shutdown procedures must be testable
- All safety-critical decisions must be auditable
- Human override capabilities required at all levels
- Regular safety training and documentation updates

### IEC 61508 (Functional Safety)

**Safety Integrity Levels (SIL):**
- SIL 1: Low risk applications (supply chain optimization)
- SIL 2: Medium risk (HVAC control, water treatment)
- SIL 3: High risk (chemical reactors, power grid)
- SIL 4: Very high risk (not recommended for AI control)

**Requirements by SIL Level:**
```
SIL 1: Basic safety functions, manual override available
SIL 2: Redundant safety systems, automatic fault detection
SIL 3: Triple redundancy, formal verification required
SIL 4: Quadruple redundancy, not suitable for ML systems
```

### ISO 27001 (Information Security)

**Security Controls:**
- Access control and authentication
- Cryptographic data protection
- Incident response procedures
- Business continuity planning

### GDPR/Privacy Regulations

**Data Protection Requirements:**
- Anonymization of sensitive industrial data
- Right to explanation for automated decisions
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Cross-border data transfer restrictions

## Industry-Specific Compliance

## Risk Management Framework

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Probability | Consequences | Risk Level | Action Required |
|-------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| Very Likely | Catastrophic | Extreme    | Immediate action, system shutdown |
| Likely      | Major        | High       | Urgent mitigation required |
| Possible    | Moderate     | Medium     | Mitigation planning needed |
| Unlikely    | Minor        | Low        | Monitor and review |
| Rare        | Negligible   | Very Low   | Accept with monitoring |

### Mitigation Strategies

**Engineering Controls:**
