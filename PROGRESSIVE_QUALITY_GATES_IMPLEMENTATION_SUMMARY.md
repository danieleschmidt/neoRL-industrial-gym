## 🧠 Adaptive Intelligence Features

### Machine Learning Adaptation Strategies

#### 1. Trend Following Adaptation
```python
# Adjusts thresholds based on quality improvement trends
if quality_trend_slope > 0:
    new_threshold = current + (trend_slope * adaptation_rate)
```

#### 2. Percentile-based Adaptation  
```python
# Sets thresholds at historical performance percentiles
target_threshold = np.percentile(historical_metrics, 25)
```

#### 3. Performance-based Adaptation
```python
# Adjusts based on violation rates vs target tolerance
if violation_rate > target_rate:
    new_threshold = current * adjustment_factor
```

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm

The system calculates adaptation confidence using multiple factors:
- **Data Consistency** (30%): Lower variance = higher confidence
- **Sample Size** (20%): More data points = higher confidence  
- **Trend Stability** (30%): Stable recent trends = higher confidence
- **Change Magnitude** (20%): Smaller changes = higher confidence
