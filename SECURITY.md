## Security Considerations

This library is designed for research and simulation. Before deploying trained policies to real industrial systems:

1. Conduct extensive safety validation
2. Implement proper monitoring and fail-safes
3. Follow your organization's safety protocols
4. Consider hiring industrial safety experts
5. Validate against OSHA and relevant regulations

## Industrial Safety Warning

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This software is intended for research and simulation only. Always validate policies extensively before deploying to real industrial systems. The maintainers are not responsible for any damage or safety incidents resulting from deployment to real systems.
